 <h2>The following steps have been followed</h2>
 <li>Step1: Command Alexa to add a To Do via Amazon Echo. These To-Dos can be such as, "Alexa add a to do: Take out trash at 7pm".</li>
 <li>Step2: Alexa adds this command to the user's Google Calendar using the "IFTTT Alexa To-Dos to Google Cal" service.</li>
 <li>Step3: Google Calendar sends To-Dos to user's Gamil using the "MixMax" add on in Google Chrome which works for automate email sending.</li>
 <li>Step4: "Checker plus for Gmail" which is another add on in Google Chrome reads the email in user's device - a Text to Speech functionality. Since, Checker plus reads everything in the email we ran a "Google App Script" to extract the calendar event and send email with just the text that was needed.</li>
